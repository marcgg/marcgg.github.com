I've always had the feeling that being "full stack" was an advantage, whatever this meant. However I got many signals that specialising was the way to go... this is why I was very happy to read this book and get more insights and stories behind people not hyper focusing on only one topic. So maybe it's just confirmation bias, but I really enjoyed going through this one as it formalised quite well a general feeling I've had for a long time about the leverage you get when you know more than one thing. Maybe that's also why I didn't really like "The One Thing" !
