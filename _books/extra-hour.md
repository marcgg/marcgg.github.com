Subtitled "Powerful Techniques to Create More Time in Your Day", this book is really a primer on productivity techniques. The authors do not get in depth on any one solution, but instead cover a wide variety of ideas that you can then deep dive into later if they sound interesting. I already knew a lot of things present in the book, but I still actually took some actions after completing it and wasn't bored reading... so that's a win if you ask me.
