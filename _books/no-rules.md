This book presents the very specific culture of Netflix. You will either love it or hate it, but it's hard to deny that this insights look isn't interesting and full of ideas that are worth trying. Their main point is that they will hire the best people, pay them high salaries, but also set high expectations and don't hesitate to let them go if needed. Thanks to this they get a team of highly performant individual, which allows them to try out a lot of experiments to drive efficiency. Most people will remember the "unlimited holidays" policy, but personnally my takeaway is that with a team of very qualified, motivated and aligned people you can pretty much do anything and you will be successful. The hard part is to get these people in the same team and have a clear goal for them to follow.
