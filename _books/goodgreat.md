In this one, the author presents the conclusions of years of research on what make companies really become "great". The work accomplished is impressive, and the book in itself is interesting to read. It's also worth noting to see how many concepts are introduced and ended up used everywhere later on, like "The Hedgehog Concept". Overall a good read around the topics of business, leadership, discipline and more... I'm happy to have read it even if there were nothing really practical I could take away from it.
