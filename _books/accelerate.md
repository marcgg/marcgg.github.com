I almost dropped this book because of a very tedious introduction around the viability of their data, that was useful but could have been turned into footnotes. However once I made it past this part, the book is full of insights about building high performing teams. I wasn't a big fan of the writting, but I still think everyone should be aware of this book and leverage some of its ideas when designing software organisations.
