I discovered this ebook after listening to [an episode of The Ruby Rogues][1], and I don't regret spending the extra time to read it. The author explains [the four rules of simple design][2] enounced by [Kent Beck][3] a while back. To do so the author uses his experience in code retreats where he saw a lot of examples surrounding various implementations of Conway's Game of Life. Overall it's a well written piece that drives the point home.
