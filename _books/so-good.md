There are many things mentioned in this book, for instance the fact that "follow your passion" is usually a bad advice. However the one thing that really stuck with me, and the reason why I really valued reading it, is the concept of "career capital". Building skills leading to building freedom, leading to loving what you do... not the other way around. I think this is a good read for anyone not really willing to put in the work to build up their skills and instead trying to rush to the finish line.
