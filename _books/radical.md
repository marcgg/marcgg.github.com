This book about OKRs is a great introduction if you do not know about the topic. It presents its advantages in a way that's way easier to digest than books like High Ouput Management: a simple novel following a few caracters struggling with keeping focus. It's not higher on my list because it's a bit too dogmatic with OKRs just solving every single problems with no issues at all once the perfect formula is respected. While I agree that having clear focus is key, the author went a bit too far with the effectiveness of this particular method.
