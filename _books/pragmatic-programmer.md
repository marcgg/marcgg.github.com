This is one of the books I've heard referenced countless times by very smart people before I actually got to read it. Expectations were high, but Andrew Hunt and David Thomas delivered. This book dives into everything that a modern developer needs to aprehend in order to create good software and stay up to date. From 'crash early' to its general pragmatic approach, I find myself quoting from this book all the time. It really is a reference for any modern programmers and a must read.
