This book is what drove a lot of people to [Ruby][1], myself included. It's weird, humoristic, filled with drawings and absurd comics... but it's also very insightful and gives great examples of why Ruby is an interesting language. The only certainty everybody have about this is that are no other programming books like this, and I enjoyed it a lot. Nowadays the examples and references are very dated, but the book is available as a [free PDF][2], so if you're interested you should browser through it!
