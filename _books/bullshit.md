I grabbed this book after seeing an article about it, and I was surprised by how in depth the author is going. It's not a fun book about the quirks of corporate nonsense, it's a deep dive into how we view and structure work. In the end I had a lot less fun than I anticipated, but I also learned quite a bit. I think it's an helpful book to get some perspective about your work, the sense behind it and what you aim to do with your career.
