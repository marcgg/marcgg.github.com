This book is, just like its predescesor the Phoenix Project, a novel about devops and software development. It takes places in the same context as Phoenix, but this time we get to follow an engineer's path to improve the build and the team's ability to deliver software. The whole thing is pleasant to read and insightful, even if some situations can feel a bit forced at point. The main takeaways are all about making engineers more productive and happy by tackling complexity and technical debt. I don't think I learned much reading this book, but it can be a good introductory read for someone less familiar with the topic.
