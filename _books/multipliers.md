This book focuses on how some leaders are able to find the genius in their colleagues and team members, therefore enabling them to express it to the fullest. There are some interesting takeaways, like the whole concept of diminisher and accidental diminishers, that can help one indentify flaws in the way they lead. However in a lot of cases it felt only relevant for people leading very senior teams where managers do not need to be very involved beyond a small nudge. If you're a senior VP, this will be interesing, however it is way less applicable if you are a line manager for a team of junior individual contributors.
