I loved learning this book about how Patagonia was built, starting from a small company selling climbing equipment to the widely known brand of today. Yvon Chouinard's philosophy can be quite inspiring and I liked getting insights on the tradeoffs and choices he had to make along the way - balancing ecological impact with building great products. I'm guessing some part of the story has been altered a bit, but I'm ok with it and I enjoyed this book a lot.
