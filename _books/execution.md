This book is about how to implement strategy in a reliable and effective way, and I really enjoyed it. At some points it felt a bit too theoritical or "zoomed out", some examples felt a bit dated (Xeros, IBM etc)... but I still loved the approach taken where leadership or strategy take a backseat to actually building the thing. Overall I think this a good read for anyone starting with a leadership position or for people curious to understand better the mindset of executives. I don't think veteran C levels will learn a lot though.
