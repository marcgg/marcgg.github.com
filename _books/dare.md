While I get why this book is interesting, it didn't speak to me directly. On paper, it's about interesting topics, mainly  leadership and the importance of taking responsibility in a meaningful and "human" way that allows for vulnerability. However I felt like reading the same couple of points I saw a thousand time before, and a lot of references of the author's other books. Overall it seemed like this could be an amazing article or talk, but having it spread over an entire book might be a bit much.
