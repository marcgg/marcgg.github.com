I wrote a few ideas on how to create a #recruitment process for software engineers: [marcgg.com/blog/2020/03/2â€¦](https://marcgg.com/blog/2020/03/23/recruitment-interviews-startup/)

I don't really get into the specific interviewing techniques, but instead focus on how to define the process itself and get people to use it.
