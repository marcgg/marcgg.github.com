I always posted blog articles on [my own site](https://marcgg.com/blog/) to keep ownership over the content I produced & to be able to display it how I wanted.

However, I never really paid attention to my microblogging on Twitter... until recently! Given all of the changes made to the platform, I decided to store [my previous tweets](https://marcgg.com/status/) on my site as well. To do this, I've migrated everything to Jekyll, but only kept the past few years online for now.

I'm not sure how I'll be posting from now on, or if this will be the most efficient move in terms of reach. I'll probably have to do a bunch of cross posting on X & Linkedin, but I like the idea of having everything I'm writing in a git repo so much I'm giving it a try anyways!
