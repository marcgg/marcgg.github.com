title: Thoughts On Company Procedures
description: In a team, you’re bound to create some structuring processes. But when does it becomes too much? Is there some golden hammer out there to fix all our organizational needs? …… no, there isn’t (but you should still give this article a read anyways).

socialmediapreview: "Regarding Red Tape"
---

To me, a formal process is just like code. A way to solve a problem. I’m not talking about best practices or common sense but real formalized ways of doing things. For instance if a team constantly have problem communicating, it could be interesting to set and enforce some kind of recurring meeting to facilitate discussions - let’s say every monday, 1 hour, all hands.

However, in some situations, leadership might want to overengineer and add processes everywhere, even if there is little to no problem. This will not improve a thing, just adding inertia and slowing down the team. If you have too much red tape, energy is wasted on enforcing the newly created procedures while legitimate ideas to improve will be buried or ignored.

Going back to my first example, if the development team is only two people in the same office talking constantly together there might not be a need for any communication process.

It’s all about adapting your processes to the situation. A brilliant organizational idea from another company might not work for your team. [Heck][1], what worked for you at some point might not even do it anymore after doubling in size!

I really like this tweet. A bit extreme but hey, the phrasing is pretty cool. Just replace “law” by “company processes” and _voilà_. What I take from it is that, **ideally**, you should have everyone in your team working well without having to apply force.

If John often arrives late in meetings doesn’t necessary mean you need to create a company policy about that. You could take 5 minutes to talk with John and try to figure out what the problem is first. Of course this solution doesn’t scale and depends on the team, so again, this has to be adapted.

To this point I’ve repeated a lot how everything should be adapted and how it depends on a given situation. The corollary of this is that anyone telling you that methodology X is [perfect][5] for _any_ team is mistaken.

I would not claim to have the perfect way to work with a team. I’m bound to make [mistakes][7], we all are. And it’s a complex subject… there are even [people writting thesis about it][8]!

The important thing is to know this and be able to adapt to the best of our abilities and keep shipping. Don’t add rules blindly, these new “laws” could have a cost outweighing their benefits.
