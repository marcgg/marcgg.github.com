To start the new year, I figured it could be fun to look back and share all the different code editors I've used so far professionally, as a student or just for fun. Note that I didn't have many screenshots from back then, so I did my best to find ones that illustrated the state of the tool when I was using it.

## As a Kid

I started coding quite young. Back then my process was to randomly stumble into different languages and tools with no real direction beyond just trying to build stuff.

### QBasic

I learned the basis of programming using QBasic running on DOS. No syntax highlighting. White on blue. The struggle was real. I also remember clearly how confusing it was to me that `PRINT` was not actually sending something to the printer.

### VB 5

Later on I was gifted a book on VB and gave it a go. It was a very different experience from QBasic, and it was quite exciting to create UIs by dragging components around. I built many toy projects with this and learned to stop using `GOTO`.

### Dreamweaver 3

At that point in time, the internet started to be a more mainstream topic, and I really wanted to be building websites. So I picked up Macromedia Dreamweaver and WYSIWYG'd my way to my first site.

### Frontpage

At that point I was part of a few programming AOL chatrooms and heard that Frontpage could interesting, so I picked it up. I remember thinking that it was just like Dreamweaver except worst and giving up on it after a few weeks.

### SiteAid

After some time building small sites, I got the impression that Real Programmersâ„¢ used HTML and not WYSIWYG tools, so I picked up an editor to change actual code and not just drag and drop components. It was very different for sure and [I built monstruosities with it](https://marcgg.com/blog/2014/04/28/frame-based-layout-bad-code/), but I really liked it and I managed to ship quite a lot of sites!

### TI-83

I'm counting this one as a code editor!

I wrote quite a lot of code directly on my Casio TI-83 during classes where I should have probably paid more attention. Note that the screenshot is non actual, I couldn't afford the much conveited silver edition.

### Flash (ActionScript)

I used to create some Flash animations for fun. The next step for me at the time was to learn ActionScript in order to make games. I never got really good at it, but I had fun with it even if I never shipped a completed game.

## As a Computer Science Student

When I was a bit older I got into a 5 year computer science / software engineering school.

### Emacs

Emacs was the editor installed on some of my engineering school's machines, so I picked it up and survived to tell the tale. I'm pretty sure I only used 5% of its capabilities, so I'm not really able to judge, but it did the job and made me feel like a [hacker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4MF2s6MLxY).

![Emacs](/assets/blog/editors/emacs.png)

### Paper

I spent quite a while writing code on paper at school. We even had exams where you would fail if your C code on paper would not compile. Good times.

Overall I think that it was a good way to force yourself to think before writing code and I would recommend anyone to try... but maybe only with pseudo code.

### TextMate

I bought my first MacBook and started using TextMate because many of my schoolmates were doing the same. I think this is one of the editor that really holds a special place for me. The UI was smooth & clean, it could do a lot but wasn't overwhelming. I also spent a lot of time watching [Ryan Bate's Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/) where he used Textmate to explain how to use Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

This one was my main go to editor for quite a long time and only gave it up after giving up on seeing TextMate 2 get released.

### Kate

When working with KDE, I used whatever was available and it happened to be Kate! I have to admit that I don't remember much from this one aside from the fact that it was there and had syntax highlighting.

### Eclipse

I did quite a lot of Java at school and during my first internships, so it came along with using Eclipse. After a bit of time in TextMate and Emacs, this felt like a bit much, but I got used to it and used it for years when working on Java projects. I never got used to the amount of ressources it was using though.

![Eclipse](/assets/blog/editors/eclipse.png)

### SciTE

At one point I worked at a company where I couldn't install anything on my machine without a very very long and complex process to follow... and I wasn't going to code with NotePad! To solve this, I ended up finding an editor that wasn't blocked because it was so lightweight. I don't think I met many people who used this one, but to this day I still have very fond memories of my time using it.

### NetBeans

After some time working with Java, I decided to give Netbeans a try to see how it would fare versus Eclipse regarding ressource consumption. It was slightly better, but had other tradeoffs so I ended up using Eclipse the most.

### Unity

I briefly gave game development a try using Unity. It was quite interesting, but at that point I decided to try to make a career in the web and not video games, so I didn't pursue for this for very long.

## As a Professional Software Engineer

Moving into my career as a software engineer, I kept using Eclipse & TextMate. I also tried a lot more than I shared here, including PhpStorm or Aptana, but I don't think I spent enough time with them to even mention.

### NotePad++

Since I've heard a lot about it, I gave NotePad++ a try for an ASP project, but I wasn't a big fan and dropped it in favor of Visual Studio fairly quickly.

![Notepad++](/assets/blog/editors/notepad.png)

### Visual Studio

I worked in the Microsoft ecosystem for a bit (C#, .NET), so I used Visual Studio with ReSharper and really liked it. The tooling by Jetbrains made a huge difference in developer experience, and despite how much I disliked .NET, it made the whole thing enjoyable.

![Visual Studio](/assets/blog/editors/visualstudio.jpg)

### Visual Studio Express

I had a nice experience with Visual Studio, but I didn't necesserally wanted to pay for it. I also thought I would be fine with only a subset of its features, so I used Visual Studio Express for a while. It was an alright tool, but when working outside of the Microsoft ecosystem I felt like it wasn't as good as the other options available.

![Visual Studio Express](/assets/blog/editors/visualexpress.png)

### Nano

This never was my main editor and I mostly used it on servers without any UI before I started getting into Vim.

![Nano](/assets/blog/editors/nano.png)

### Sublime

I started using Sublime around 2010, mainly because the "search & replace in project" feature of TextMate was so clunky. It was pretty good and I did use it for a while, alternating with TextMate. However I never really got into it and I ended up abandonning it for Vim.

![Sublime](/assets/blog/editors/sublime.png)

### RubyMine

Since I was using Ruby quite a lot, I figured I would give this IDE a go. It was pretty interesting to see everything possible, but it felt like a bit much and took away from the simplicity that drove me to Ruby after a few years using Java... so I stopped using it and went back to TextMate or Sublime when coding in Ruby. I also like the idea of a "general" code editor much more than one made for a specific language.

![Ruby Mine](/assets/blog/editors/rubymine.png)

## Present

For the past ~10 years I've stuck to mostly the same tools. I did try Atom and VSCode, but by the time they were available I was already too deep into Vim. It was doing everything I wanted it to do, so I never felt the need to switch.

### Vim

In 2012 I had been coding for a while and got a bit tired of constantly learning new code editors & IDEs. To address that, [I picked up Vim](https://marcgg.com/blog/2012/09/04/one-reason-to-switch-to-vim-editor/) hoping it will be a good tool for a very long time. So far I'm still very happy about it and I managed to get it to do everything I wanted except iOS development. I will sometimes try a new editor but I always ended up coming back to Vim and maybe adding a few plugins to get the new features I found interesting in said new editor.

For the record I'm not a complete purist and actually use MacVim. Back then it was an easier transition out of TextMate and I got used to it so I never saw the upside of switching to.

### XCode

I'm building iOS apps, and despite my best effort using Vim, XCode clearly remains the best developer experience for this task. Because of this, I learned how to use it and now I find it pretty good, especially when working with SwiftUI previews. It might be stockholm syndrome, I'm not sure.

![XCode](/assets/blog/editors/xcode.png)

## Future

For iOS development, I don't think I'll be able to get away from **XCode** so this one is here to stay.

For everything else, I'm looking more and more at **Neovim**. I would still get to leverage my knowledge of Vim and its ecosystem, but also get to enjoy more advanced customisation with Lua among other things.
