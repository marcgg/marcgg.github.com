When talking about work, I often find myself referencing various laws, adages and principles as I find it to be a great shortcut and leverages a common understanding of the topic and domain. Of course they are not perfectly true in 100% of cases, but there is a reason that they turned into common sayings.

Since I have trouble remembering names, this article is both my way to share the sayings I mention the most and to build myself a cheat sheet! My goal is not to list all the common ones, but instead focus on the few that I really mention frequently.

**Brandolini’s Law**: "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it."

**Brook's Law**: "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."

**Conway's Law:** "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

**Gall's Law**: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."

**Goodhart's Law:** "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

**Hanlon's Razor**: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."

**Hofstadter’s Law**: "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law."

**Law of Demeter**: "Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units ‘closely’ related to the current unit."

**Ninety-Ninety Rule**: “The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time”

**Pareto Principle**: "Roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes."

**Parkinson’s Law**: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”

**Peter Principle**: "In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence."

**Wirth’s Law**: "Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster."
