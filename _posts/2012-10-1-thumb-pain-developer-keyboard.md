Most coders complain about wrist pain. For some reason I never had major trouble there except when working for hours on a laptop. My main issue seemed more original and was located in [the group of muscles controlling the thumb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thenar_eminence). Suddently it would hurt for days, then go away, then come back... good times.

Eventually I mentioned it to a kinesiotherapist, and the conversation was very similar to the famous joke that goes something like:

> « Doctor, it hurts when I do this.
>
> -Don’t do it then! »

Of course this got me thinking: why do I use my thumb so much?

Turns out that the movement of pressing a combination of keys was the thing causing the pain. Of course doing it every once in a while has no consequence, but as a web developer I spend my day opening browser tabs (cmd+T), refreshing pages (cmd+R) and copy and pasting (cmd+C, cmd+V).

As you can see on this terribly filmed video, I tend to twist a bit the thumb to press both keys at the same time. It’s not much but because it’s not a natural position, the repetition of this hundreds of times a day would cause pain.

My first idea was to force myself to use the second cmd button, but I didn’t like it since it would require taking my hand off the mouse for a second. What worked for me was [changing the mapping of Caps Lock](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127591/using-caps-lock-as-esc-in-mac-os-x) to Cmd so I could do the gesture with one hand. This allowed me to use my little finger for these action and avoid stressing the thumb muscles.

I’ve been doing this for a few months now, and I do see a difference. If you encounter the same problem, feel free to try this solution out and let me know if it helped!
