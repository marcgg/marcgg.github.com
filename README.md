# marcgg.com

This is my personal website running with jekyll and hosted on Github
pages. Feel free to visit it on [marcgg.com](https://www.marcgg.com).

Also if I were you I wouldn't pay too much attention to how everything
is implemented here. I mostly spend my time here working on content,
not on code.

## Setting it up

```
git clone https://github.com/marcgg/marcgg.github.com.git
cd marcgg.github.com
```

Accept rvmrc prompt

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

Access http://localhost:4000/ to see the blog
