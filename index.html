    <p>
      My main focus is on my job of VP of Engineering, leading the technical team at
      <a href="https://www.drivy.com/" class="drivy" target="_blank">Drivy</a>,
      the largest european car sharing company.
      Aside from this, I provide dedicated coaching for various startups,
      including YC alumni companies.
      Finally, I also have experience teaching online (OpenClassrooms) or
      in front of students (HETIC, HEC...)

          <li>
            <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{post.title}}</a>
            {%capture tag%}{% if post.publictag %}{{post.publictag}}{% else %}{{ post.tag }}{% endif %}{%endcapture%}
            <span class="home-tag tag-{{tag | downcase | remove: " "}}">{{tag}}</span>
            <span class="home-tag tag-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y" }}</span>
          </li>
        {%endif%}
      {%endfor%}
