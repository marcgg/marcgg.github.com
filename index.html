<h1>Hello!</h1>

  <span>I build useful software and help others do the same</span>

    <p>
      My main focus is on my job of VP of Engineering, leading the technical team at
      <a href="https://www.drivy.com/" class="drivy" target="_blank">Drivy</a>,
      the largest european peer to peer car rental company.
      Aside from this, I provide dedicated coaching for various early stage startups,
      including YC alumni companies.
      Finally, I'm also teaching online (OpenClassrooms) or in front of students (HETIC, HEC...)

      I've also been blogging for the past 5 years. If you'd like to get a feel of
      what I've had my mind on, you can take a look at a few of my most successful articles:

    <ul>
      {% for post in site.posts %}
        {%if post.featured%}
          <li>
            <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{post.title}}</a>
            {%capture tag%}{% if post.publictag %}{{post.publictag}}{% else %}{{ post.tag }}{% endif %}{%endcapture%}
            <span class="home-tag tag-{{tag | downcase | remove: " "}}">{{tag}}</span>
            <span class="home-tag tag-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y" }}</span>
          </li>
        {%endif%}
      {%endfor%}
    </ul>
