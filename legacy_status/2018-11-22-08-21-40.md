@AntoineAugusti @shannonxfiles @Drivy_FR @mickeyben Hello! We open sourced data checkers recently but more on the Ruby/app side ([drivy.engineering/checker-jobs/](https://drivy.engineering/checker-jobs/)). There are no short term plan of open sourcing the ones mentioned in Antoine's article, but it is not excluded.
