@AntoineAugusti Interesting one! I'd love to see this one [cl.ly/1i1q3X2q2s0N](https://cl.ly/1i1q3X2q2s0N) normalised in term of % of the population. For instance just like this, "2.4% with farmers parents" could be very high or very low depending on how many farmers are out there, and how many kids they are having.
