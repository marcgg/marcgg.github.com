      <p>
        I've been building software for more than 15 years in startups & scale ups,
        including Back Market or Drivy / Getaround. I've been through the early phases
        many times, hired many engineers, designed organisation, built strategies and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you feel like your project is not moving fast enough,
        if you are encountering a new complex topic, if you're not sure
        what should be your next move regarding product or engineering,
        I can help you by ...
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Coaching you or your team to create or scale a product.</strong>
          If you are struggling with a particular point in your software
          production, be it work organization, vision, focus or something more
          technical, it can slow down your delivery. I can help you get over
          some roadblocks and move faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audit or help you build your software engineering processes.</strong>
          Once you've built your MVP, it's important to you keep moving fast, deliver on time
          and don't introduce bugs. A strong engineering culture alongside simple
          yet effective processes can go a long way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Helping you recruit developers or find your CTO.</strong>
          I'll be able to give you an external and technical
          point of view on any candidate you might want to hire.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sharing insights on how to organise or scale your team.</strong>
          It's hard to figure out what is the best setup for a given team.
          You probably heard of squads, tribes, agile team, impact teams... I can
          help you gain more clarity over what would work in your organisation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bouncing ideas with you or your team.</strong>
          Experience has shown me that having a mostly unbiased third party to discuss
          tricky topic can help reach a decision quicker.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Facilitate a workshop.</strong>
          You want to brainstorm a new concept, raly your team behind an idea or maybe build a long
          term vision. I can help you by helping you setup a successful workshop with your team.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Engineering Leadership: Drivy & Getaround</h3>
        <img src="/assets/misc/drivy-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
        <p class="example-desc">
          I lead the entire Drivy engineering team, scaling it from a few engineers to ~40 people
          until it was
          <a href='https://www.ft.com/content/4fe95aac-6682-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056'>acquired by Getaround.</a>

          There I also worked on most of the company's technical components
          such as the search algorithm, mobile API, fraud detection
          algorithms, pricing structure, internal workflow tools,
          driver/car matching algorithm, payment infrastructure...

      <div class="project">
        <h3>In Person Classes: HEC</h3>
        <img src="/assets/misc/hec-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
        <p class="example-desc">
          I gave classes and lead workshops for HEC
          (large French business school) students wanting
          to create their own startup. As far as I know, it was the first time people
          were writting JavaScript in this business school.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Engineering Leadership: Back Market</h3>
        <img src="/assets/misc/backmarket-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
        <p class="example-desc">
          As a Director of Engineering I took the lead of the customer facing side of
          the engineering team. This meant multiple teams working on everything from
          onboarding (SEO, content, trust...) to search, recommendation and then actual purchase
          funnel on the apps and the web.  I also lead the side of the product that handled recycling and
          purchasing of used devices.
          One of the many significant challenges was to scale the team
          and processes to fit the <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/back-market-reaches-5-7b-valuation-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/'>quick growth of the company</a>
          (went from a dozen people in my team up to approximativaly sixty).

          As tech advisor I contributed to

      <h2>Working Together</h2>
      <p>
        The process might differ depending on the situation, but in most cases here is what a collaboration would look like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We have a <strong>first free initial call</strong> or we meet over coffee if you're in Paris. The goal will be for me to better understand your needs, and for you to get a sense of if I am be the right person for the job. At the end of this we decide to work together or not</li>

        <li>We plan <strong>a few meetings (remotely or in person) to work on a given topic</strong> defined during the initial meeting. It can be  anything from a few hours to a couple of days. I like to have dense meetings and time appart so that you can try out ideas, read materials or talk to your team.</li>

        <li>Based on the result of these initial meetings, we either <strong>keep going</strong> with a recurring coaching session, a longer form workshop, a meeting with other people from your company... or we decide to <strong>stop there</strong> for the time being.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
      I like to get into long term relationships with my clients, so it's not unusual to have coaching sessions for a few weeks, then nothing for a few months, and then get back in touch to work on a new topic that appeared. In a lot of cases we gain can just pick the conversation up where we left it.
      </p>
      <p>
      My goal is always to solve your problem as fast as possible by giving you lots of ideas, references and advices so that you can move forward on your own. If at any point I feel I'm not relevant for your current problem I'll tell you so and we'll pause the coaching.
      </p>


      <h2>Contacting Me</h2>
      <p>
        To contact me, you can send me an email with your project at
        <strong>marcg.gauthier -at- gmail -dot- com</strong>. From there, we'll plan a first free call so that I
        better understand what I could help you with, and then we can decide to work together or not.
        Finally, if you need to see me in person, I'm localized in Paris... so that's where I'll be!
