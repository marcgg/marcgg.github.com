        If you feel like your project is not moving fast enough,
        if you have trouble getting started, if you're not sure
        what should be your next move regarding engineering,
        I can help you by ...
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Coaching you or your team to create or scale a product.</strong>
          If you are struggling with a particular point in your software
          production, be it work organization or something more
          technical, it can slow down your delivery. I can help you get over
          some roadblocks and move faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audit or help you build your software engineering processes.</strong>
          Once you've built your MVP, it's important to you keep moving fast, deliver on time
          and don't introduce bugs. A strong engineering culture alongside simple
          yet effective processes can go a long way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Helping you recruit developers or find your CTO.</strong>
          I'll be able to give you an external and technical
          point of view on any candidate you might want to hire.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Teaching non technical people about development.</strong>
          As a founder or product owner in a technology focused company,
          it is very important to have some technical knowledge
          to work effeciently. To do so, no
          need to become a full time developer: I can help you to
          quickly grasp the main concepts so you'll be able to understand
          what your technical team is doing.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <p class="example-desc">
          As a Director of Engineering I took the lead of the customer facing side of
          the engineering team. This meant multiple teams working on everything from
          onboarding (SEO, content, trust...) to search, recommendation and then actual purchase
          funnel on the apps and the web. One of the many significant challenges was to scale the team
          and processes to fit the quick growth of the company.

      <h2>Working Together</h2>
      <p>
        The process might differ depending on the situation, but in most cases here is what a collaboration would look like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We have a <strong>first free initial call</strong>. The goal will be for me to better understand your needs, and for you to get a sense of if I would be the right person for the job. At the end of this we decide to work together or no</li>

        <li>We plan <strong>a few meetings (remotely or in person) to work on a given topic</strong> defined during the initial call. Usually it's good to start with only a couple of hours spread over a week or two and take it from there. I like to have dense meetings and time appart so that you can try out ideas, read materials or talk to your team.</li>

        <li>Based on the result of these initial meetings, we either <strong>keep going</strong> with a recurring coaching session, a longer form workshop, a meeting with other people from your company... or we decide to <strong>stop there</strong> for the time being.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
      I like to get into long term relationships with my clients, so it's not unusual to have coaching sessions for a few weeks, then nothing for a few months, and then get back in touch to work on a new topic that appeared. In a lot of cases we gain can just pick the conversation up where we left it.
      </p>
      <p>
      My goal is always to solve your problem as fast as possible by giving you lots of ideas, references and advices so that you can move forward on your own. If at any point I feel I'm not relevant for your current problem I'll tell you so and we'll pause the coaching.
      </p>
      <h2>Contacting Me</h2>
      <p>
        To contact me, you can send me an email with your project at
        <strong>marcg.gauthier -at- gmail -dot- com</strong>. From there, we'll plan a first free call so that I
        better understand what I could help you with, and then we can decide to work together or not.
        Finally, if you need to see me in person, I'm localized in Paris... so that's where I'll be!
