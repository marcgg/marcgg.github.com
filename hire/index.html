        If you feel like your project is not moving fast enough,
        if you have trouble getting started, if you're not sure
        what should be your next move regarding engineering,
        I can help you by ...
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Coaching you or your team to create or scale a product.</strong>
          If you are struggling with a particular point in your software
          production, be it work organization or something more
          technical, it can slow down your project. I can help you get over
          some roadblocks and move faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audit or help you build your software engineering processes.</strong>
          Once you've built your MVP, it's important to you keep moving fast, deliver on time
          and don't introduce bugs. A strong engineering culture and simple
          yet effective processes can go a long way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Helping you recruit developers or find your CTO.</strong>
          I'll be able to give you an external and technical
          point of view on any candidate you might want to hire.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Teaching non technical people about development.</strong>
          As a founder or product owner in a technology focused company,
          it is very important to have some technical knowledge
          to work effeciently. To do so, no
          need to become a full time developer: I can help you to
          quickly grasp the main concepts so you'll be able to understand
          what your technical team is doing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Some Projects</h2>

      <h3>Plato (formerly Birdly)</h3>
      <img src="/assets/misc/birdly-yc.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />

      <p class="example-desc">
        I helped a young team of entrepreneurs with no development background
        <a href="/blog/2014/12/16/coaching-startup-birdly-le-camping/">
          get accepted into Numa (previously "Le Camping")
        </a>, and then
        <a href="/blog/2016/03/14/birdly-ycombinator/">get accepted into YCombinator</a>.
        As tech advisor I contributed to
        technical decisions and figuring out how to handle the software side
        of their company while undergoing multiple pivots.
      </p>

      <h3>Drivy (acquired by Getaround)</h3>
      <img src="/assets/misc/drivy-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
      <p class="example-desc">
        I've lead the engineering team, scaling it from a few engineers to ~40 people.
        I also worked on most of the company's technical components
        such as the search algorithm, the mobile API, the fraud detection
        algorithms, the pricing structure, the internal workflow tools,
        the driver/car matching algorithm, the payment infrastructure...
      </p>

      <h3>HEC</h3>
      <img src="/assets/misc/hec-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
      <p class="example-desc">
        I gave classes and lead workshops for HEC students wanting
        to create a web startup. As far as I know, it's the first time people
        were writting JavaScript in this business school.
      </p>

      <h3>WiFilles</h3>
      <img src="/assets/misc/wifilles-complete.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
      <p class="example-desc">
        I was in charge of the code section in the first promotion of WiFilles,
        a never seen before program to introduce girls to computer
        sciences. It was a success and WiFilles is gaining more and more traction.
      </p>

      <h3>MOOCs</h3>
      <img src="/assets/misc/mooc-example.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
      <p class="example-desc">
        I wrote and presented, in collaboration with OpenClassrooms, two MOOCs about Ruby and Git.
        They are still online and followed by tens of thousands of students.
      </p>
