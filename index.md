I've been building software for more than 15 years. I started as a fullstack engineer for various startups. I then worked for 8 years as VP of Engineering at Drivy, then acquired by [Getaround][1], the leading car sharing company working on building a viable alternative to car ownership. After this, I worked as Director of Engineering for [Back Market][5] during 3 years, contributing to reduce e-waste through its marketplace for refurbished electronics.

Today, I'm bootstrapping a [boxing fitness app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadow-boxing-workout-app/id1510911574) as well as providing [dedicated coaching](/hire/) for various companies to help them get over roadblocks.

I've been blogging for quite a while. If you'd like to get a feel of what I've had on my mind, you can take a look at a few of my most successful articles:
