Hello, I'm [Marc][3]!

I first started as a fullstack engineer for various startups in France and the US. I then worked as a technical lead and then evolved into  VP of Engineering at Drivy. The company was then acquired by [Getaround][1], the leading car sharing company working on building a viable alternative to car ownership. After this, I worked as Director of Engineering for [Back Market][5] during 3 years, contributing to reduce e-waste through its marketplace for refurbished electronics.

I've also taught many people how to build software in various ways, ranging from evening classes aimed at professionals, 1 on 1 executive coaching or even workshops for young teens. I've worked with large schools like HEC or HETIC, but also collaborated with many entrepreneurs to help them improve how they worked.

Today, I'm building my own products as well as providing [dedicated help](/hire/) for various companies and executives to get them over roadblocks. If you want to hire me, please check out [this page][4] that gets into more details.

If needed, you can reach me via [Linkedin][3] or using email "marcg.gauthier-at-gmail-dot-com". You can also follow me on [Bluesky][6].
