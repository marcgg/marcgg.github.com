I worked for 8 years as VP of Engineering Europe at [Getaround][1], the leading car sharing company working on building a viable alternative to car ownership. Now my main focus is my Head of Engineering position at [Back Market][5], attempting to reduce e-waste through its marketplace for refurbished electronics.

Alongside this, I provide dedicated coaching for various companies to help them get over roadblocks.

I've been blogging for the past 10 years. If you'd like to get a feel of what I've had on my mind, you can take a look at a few of my most successful articles:
