A bit about me, it's my site after all!

I've been building software for more than 15 years. I first started as a fullstack engineer for various startups in France and the US. I then worked as a technical lead and then evolved into a VP of Engineering at Drivy. The company was then acquired by [Getaround][1], the leading car sharing company working on building a viable alternative to car ownership. After this, I worked as Director of Engineering for [Back Market][5] during 3 years, contributing to reduce e-waste through its marketplace for refurbished electronics.

I've also taught many people how to build software in various ways, ranging from evening classes aimed at professionals, 1 on 1 executive coaching or even workshops for teens. I've worked with large schools like HEC or HETIC, but also collaborated with many entrepreneurs to help them improve how they worked.

Today, I'm building my own products as well as providing [dedicated coaching](/hire/) for various companies and executives to help them get over roadblocks. If you want to hire me, please check out [this page][4] that gets into more details.
