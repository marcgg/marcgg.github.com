    As first-time founders, there was a \"before\" and an \"after\" Marc.

    He helped us accelerate on different aspects of building a tech product: getting the right process in place not only on the technical side (deployment, tools, security...) but also from a management standpoint: 1:1s, hiring, managing teams, etc."

    Marc supported us for several weeks during the technical and HR integration following our M&A operation.

    His advice, backed by solid professional experience as both a developer and engineering leader, was invaluable in helping us make the right structural decisions.

    Beyond his technical expertise, Marc brought a rare mix of clarity, kindness, and positive energy that made working with him both efficient and enjoyable

    I met Marc during our years at Drivy. He did a tremendous job managing the tech team with strong organizational skills, thinking about employee development and performance from a technical and human point of view.

    It was obvious for me to reach out to him when we faced similar issues within AssoConnect. As CTO's chief of staff, I suggested a few hours with Marc to have an external eye and gather relevant pieces of advice.
    After his intervention, we made some changes with almost immediate results thanks to Marc!
