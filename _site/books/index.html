It’s really a must read for anyone working in software development. From the title, it seems aimed at managers, but really everybody would benefit from it as it’s more about interactions between people inside a company. Of course, like any books about humans, nothing is to be taken at face value and there are some generalizations I didn’t agree with, but overall the content is well written and insightful.</p> <div class="book-rating"> <span class="top"><span class="icon">✓✓✓</span>Amazing book, everybody should read it</span> </div> </p> </div> <div class="single-post master-book-data" data-author=" Sandi Metz" data-title="Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby" data-link="" data-linkfr="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/0321721330/ref=as\ li\ tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1642&creative=6746&creativeASIN=0321721330&linkCode=as2&tag=mg092-21" data-linkus="http://amzn.to/2cQTc6V"> <div class="title"> <a href="http://amzn.to/2cQTc6V">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a> <div class="author">by Sandi Metz</div> </div> <p class="description"> <a href="http://amzn.to/2cQTc6V" class="book-cover-entry"> <img src="/assets/books/poodr-cover.jpg" alt="Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby book cover" /> <br> &rarr; <span class="buy-book">Buy this book</span> </a> <p>An in depth look at how to be more efficient and future proof when writting object oriented code.

When I discovered that there were a book compiling a lot of these insights, I was more than happy to buy it.

You follow an organisation with problems and how its members are going to fix it. I personally loved it and would recommend to anyone part of a leadership team. Reading about concepts such as absence of trust or fear of conflict is made way more engaging by taking this approach focused on a group of characters, and on top of that the situations showcased are realistic and there are a lot of actionnable points.</p> <div class="book-rating"> <span class="top"><span class="icon">✓✓✓</span>Amazing book, everybody should read it</span> </div> </p> </div> <div class="single-post master-book-data" data-author="G.

The first chapters are all about discovering all the horrifying ways in which IT operations can fail. It’s a lot of fun. The rest of the book is spent in interesting explainations on how to fix and improve the situation. Being used to work in somewhat small companies, it made me rethink how I saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> movement as I never really really understood before how distant development &amp; operations can be in larger groups.</p> <div class="book-rating"> <span class="top"><span class="icon">✓✓✓</span>Amazing book, everybody should read it</span> </div> </p> </div> <div class="single-post master-book-data" data-author="Dale Carnegie" data-title="How To Win Friends And Influence People" data-link="" data-linkfr="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1439199191/ref=as li tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1642&creative=6746&creativeASIN=1439199191&linkCode=as2&tag=mg092-21" data-linkus="http://amzn.to/2cvZPfr"> <div class="title"> <a href="http://amzn.to/2cvZPfr">How To Win Friends And Influence People</a> <div class="author">by Dale Carnegie</div> </div> <p class="description"> <a href="http://amzn.to/2cvZPfr" class="book-cover-entry"> <img src="/assets/books/win-friends-cover.jpg" alt="How To Win Friends And Influence People book cover" /> <br> &rarr; <span class="buy-book">Buy this book</span> </a> <p>This must be one of the worse title for a book I’ve ever seen.
